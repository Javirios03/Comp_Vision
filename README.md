# paper-piano
## Project Description
Welcome to paper-piano! We are Pepe Ridruejo and Fco. Javier Ríos, students of the 3º year of IMAT (*Ingeniería Matemática e Inteligencia Artificial*) in ICAI.
This is our final project for the subject of Computer Vision. It has 2 main parts: One devoted towards detecting patterns (specifically, shapes), using them to decode a system and tracking the shapes. The other one, which we loved making, is an implementation of a virtual piano on keyboard
In order to know how to try the project, please refer to the Report PDF included in the Repository. We really hope you like it!
